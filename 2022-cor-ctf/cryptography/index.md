# corCTF 2022 Cryptography Challenges Writeups


In this short blog, I will discuss my approaches & solutions to some of the `corCTF 2022` cryptography challenges.

Specifically, I will explain my solutions to the challenges `exchanged` & `leapfrog`, which involved playing a bunch with some [**LCG**s ('Linear Congruential Generators')](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator)

Le'ts get started!
